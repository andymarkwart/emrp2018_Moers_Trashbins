# Georeferencing and calculating minimum distance and shortest path

## Introduction
Given the image file of Moers city and coordinate points and the locations of the garbage bins, the main task was to do georeferencing and finding the shortest path as well as shortest distance from a particular bin to any other bins. In this task, GQIS 2.18 and 3.0 versions were used and different methodologies were followed to calculate the desired results.
